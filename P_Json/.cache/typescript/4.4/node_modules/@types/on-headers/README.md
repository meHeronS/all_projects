 * are sent to the client.
 *
 * When this is called multiple times on the same res, the listeners
 * are fired in the reverse order they were added.
 *
 * @param res HTTP server response object
 * @param listener Function to call prior to headers being emitted,
 *        the response object is passed as this context.
